# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of the analysis is to help Louise to understand how campaigns do in relation to their launch date and their funding goals.  

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

For this analysis, I used a pivot table with filters that allowed me to narrow the information to what I needed. After that, I used a line graph to help the visualization analysis through time. In the graph, we can easily see how each outcome performs each month. The canceled outcome for this specific category is very low. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

For this analysis, I used the count if function with certain parameters to understand how the projects performed according to the settled goal. After that, I used a line graph to see clearly the percentage of each outcome through a set of ranges.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

It is important to understand the purpose of your analysis first because you can make a lot of VLOOKUPs, PIVOT Tables, and Graphs without knowing what you are looking for.

I found it difficult to use the countif function, I hadn't used it in the past, and it was difficult to understand how to replicate the function according to each row and column of the table. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

First conclusion - While failed and canceled outcomes remain almost flat all the year, successful outcomes present a high peak in may

Second conclusion - Something should be reviewed to understand why in October there are no canceled projects

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

It is important to define wisely your goal. Even though there weren't outcomes canceled for the "plays" subcategory, the percentage of failed outcomes was high, specifically for goals above 45000$. Additionally, a very high percentage of successful projects is presented when the goal was beyond 10,000$

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Even though we have plenty of information, what probably affected the outcomes of 2003 or another year may not affect the results now. So, the data is useful but we need to understand which variables may be useful and which ones may not be according to the place and time. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We can create another graph to compare the outcome vs the country or the duration of the campaign. This information could be useful to understand if it would be better to start a project on a specific date, with a specific goal, in a specific country, and within a specific amount of time.
